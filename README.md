Simple Shell Group Project- Cohort 19
Description
This is a recreation of Bash (Getnet and hilina) that contains limited functionality. this emulation of the shell will provide us with a better understanding of the inner workings of how a functional shell program operates. We will be using what we have previously learned in the trimester as well as learning a few new concepts as we work on this project.
